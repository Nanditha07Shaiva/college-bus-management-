"PHP &amp; MySQL College Bus Management System"
 The College Bus Management System is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL that helps manage and streamline bus services for a college.
It allows students to view available buses, check seat availability, book seats, and view/cancel their bookings.
Drivers can log in to see passenger lists, manage schedules, and track total student counts per trip.
This system is designed to improve efficiency, reduce manual booking errors, and provide real-time updates on bus operations.
